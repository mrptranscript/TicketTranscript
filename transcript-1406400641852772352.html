the community and multiple departments in-game and on discord. I always try my best to get both sides of every story to ensure the best possible communication and to get a better understanding of each situation to provide the best possible outcome. I am always willing to improve anything like knowledge, Skill. I will always listen to higher ups while working as a team with other departments to provide the best experience possible. I will always be available if a department head or member needs to contact me with any concerns of potential issues with a department.</discord-message><discord-message id="m-1406414943300882442" timestamp="2025-08-16T23:10:52.409Z" edited="false" highlight="false" profile="692609508589174805">Do you understand that abusing your permissions as Department Oversight will result in termination from staff (if applicable) and a permanent ban from all departments?<br/>I understand if i abuse any permissions as a Department Oversight i will be immediately terminated from the Staff Team and a permanent ban from all Department that is part of MRP, i will never abuse any permissions granted to me as a Department Oversight as it completely wrong to ever abuse any permissions given to anyone, as a department oversight it our job to provide the best experience possible not to make the wrong experience.</discord-message><discord-message id="m-1406414986632233013" timestamp="2025-08-16T23:11:02.740Z" edited="false" highlight="false" profile="692609508589174805">How would you handle conflicts between departments?<br/>I would first try to figure out why departments are having any type of conflict by speaking with each department HR and SHR, i would then try to come up with an agreement that can help both departments work together as a team again, i would inform the current Department Oversight over the one department and work with them to come up with a solution for both departments to fellow to avoid any further conflicts. I would then monitor departments to make sure they follow the solution / agreement so each department can continue to operate efficiently without having conflicts with each other. I will always get both sides of the story before trying a solution so I can come up with the best solution possible.</discord-message><discord-message id="m-1406415236268818642" timestamp="2025-08-16T23:12:02.258Z" edited="false" highlight="false" profile="692609508589174805">What steps would you take if you noticed rule violations within a department?<br/>I would do an investigation to gather additional proof of all rule violations within said department. Then I would inform the department head of anything they need to change as soon as possible to avoid rule violations within the department, I would then inform SHR of any rule violations that occurred that violated multiple violations and a SHR is needed to address the problem as it may cause a problem within the server discord server. If the Department head is violating any server rules that require the department head to be removed i would first gather proof of any violation take screenshots of log and message then inform SHR of the problem to request to remove the current department head and pick a new department head who can lead the department forward.</discord-message><discord-message id="m-1406415339708747947" timestamp="2025-08-16T23:12:26.920Z" edited="false" highlight="false" profile="692609508589174805">Why do you want this role, and what impact do you hope to make?<br/><br/>I want this role so I can work alongside other departments to make it an  amazing experience for all members of the MRP community so everyone can have a wonderful experience in one of our departments.<br/>I hope to make an impact by ensuring all our departments are as realistic as possible and organized so it is easy for new members to join our departments without having any trouble.<br/>I would also like to help our departments become more active within the community as currently they are not very active beside 1-2 departments that are active.<br/>I would also help department heads and members with anything they need such as which role is allowed to use certain uniforms etc. I will also make sure I am available for department heads and members to DM me for any problems or questions they may have.<br/>I would like to see more department work together as a team within the community and in-game so we can provide an amazing experience and amazing opportunity for members to join any department and be part of this amazing journey to a super awesome community.</discord-message><discord-message id="m-1406415385187713174" timestamp="2025-08-16T23:12:37.763Z" edited="false" highlight="false" profile="692609508589174805"><discord-mention type="user">Excusty</discord-mention> ignore.<discord-reactions slot="reactions"><discord-reaction name="âœ…" emoji="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/14.0.2/svg/2705.svg" count="1"></discord-reaction></discord-reactions></discord-message><discord-message id="m-1407589640692699156" timestamp="2025-08-20T04:58:42.092Z" edited="false" highlight="false" profile="1208273293237551165">Hai!
