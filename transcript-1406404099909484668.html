Firstly I am active and professional, which allows me to respond to problems quickly, handle them in a good manor, while keeping order. I handle high-stress situations with several people well. I have vast experience with department management, staffing in several positions (from Moderator to Director), both in FiveM (which can be extremely stressful), to ERLC and even other games... (Will send rest due to discord message cap.)<br/><discord-bold>2.)</discord-bold> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m better than anyone else, and I am sure that there are other people who are just as good candidates. However I am active (unless there is significant weather ongoing), I have years of experience with staffing and department management, and I am professional. I always use SPaG, follow protocol, and approach every situation differently so I can rectify it as quickly as possible.<br/><discord-bold>3.)</discord-bold> Yes.<br/><discord-bold>4.)</discord-bold> My tactics would change based on what is happening. Is it 2 small departments, is it every single department? Firstly, I would speak with the 03&#x27;s, 02&#x27;s and 01&#x27;s of all of the departments involved and try and find out whats happening. From there we would set forward an intervention plan. If this doesn&#x27;t rectify the issue, possible demotions/replacements could be necessary.<br/><discord-bold>5.)</discord-bold> This would depend on who committed the violation. If its Department Leadership, I would collect evidence, open a case, and issue a punishment myself. If its someone such as a Deputy, I would collect evidence but would send it to their supervisor, since DO wouldn&#x27;t handle every single infraction.<br/><discord-bold>6.)</discord-bold> I hope to bring activity to the departments and make sure they&#x27;re always running the best they can possibly be. Often good departments bring forward lots of activity, which is something we need here at Michigan. I also want to help start the departments, as if you don&#x27;t have a good foundation, you won&#x27;t be able to get far.<discord-reactions slot="reactions"><discord-reaction name="‚úÖ" emoji="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/14.0.2/svg/2705.svg" count="1"></discord-reaction></discord-reactions></discord-message><discord-message id="m-1406407374947745886" timestamp="2025-08-16T22:40:47.973Z" edited="false" highlight="false" profile="819370129321099315">#1 continued: <br/><br/>I also a good at making protocols for handling investigations, such as case formats, documentation, etc. I also know how to get to the root cause of an issue quickly, and make a resolution.</discord-message><discord-message id="m-1407589605221470248" timestamp="2025-08-20T04:58:33.635Z" edited="false" highlight="false" profile="1208273293237551165">Hai!
