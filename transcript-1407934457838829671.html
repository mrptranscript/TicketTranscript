You should choose me because I can bring determination, professionalism, grammar, and the best department leadership you have ever seen.<br/><br/>3. I do not have any past department administration but I do have some friends that have gave me tips in the past and I take notes on how department admins act in other departments.<br/><br/>4. I can better WCSO by first, updating the bots and roles to have it look more organized, this the first step.<br/>Second step is to demote everyone so it can get more organized and then I would need them to DM me on how they are fit for their rank. If they are a Deputy then they would be trained again with their trainer be given a handbook to help for further steps in the training process. Next is to get all the bots working and getting the divisions set like Criminal Investigation, Tactical Team and More.<br/><br/>5. When I am provided an application and I check that a member has used AI to fill their application, I would go to the MSP command team and explain the situation to them. I would provide the MSP command team the user, the member that used AI, and have them access to the application. Next, I would question them both in order to get some more details out of them that I can provide to the MSP. Then I would blacklist one of member from applying for Deputy or if they were already a rank for WCSO, they would be under investigation.<br/><br/>6. If I were to be asked to promote one of my trusted friends/members to the position that the head of division is being fired for what so ever reason I provide, I would need the trusted to go through training, take an exam that I would create so I know what they would do, and then have it be voted to the WCSO command board which I will be making to assist with applications, high rank roles, ranking a new person, and updating the server to ensure that it is steady, in a calm stream, and that it acts like an actual whitelisted department.</discord-message><discord-message id="m-1407938739887411200" timestamp="2025-08-21T04:05:53.826Z" edited="false" server="false" highlight="false" profile="497196352866877441"><discord-reply slot="reply" edited="false" attachment="false" author="W-01 | RealTLXWinterWolf" avatar="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/1251555837978218639/09c561064d6ff52b3e11ab7ea3660cc6.webp?size=32" role-color="#fbdaa1" bot="false" verified="false" op="false" server="false" command="false"><span data-goto="1407938731872223293">1.

I would first ask for the evidence and see if it connects to the report that has been given to them. Then I would ask for some more details on both sides so I can see if I would need to revoke the infraction or have the infraction kept. If my friend provides me with some shaky evidence, I&#x27;d ask them to provide me with some more evidence that would lead to the report. Then I would involve the command board to assist me with this report so that they can get more details and if one needs to get off, another command can take over and handle the report.<br/><br/>9. When my 03 has raided the department a month prior I was getting for ideas, I would start an investigate on my 03. He would be off the department for now and be put under investigation. I would ask the head of the department that I was scouting and ask for some details about how it was going and if I can get any messages that could relate to the raid. Then if I was provided evidence that my 03 raided, he would be terminated from the server and I would report him to Michigan Roleplay about what he did.<br/><br/>10. I would not cave in because since wouldn&#x27;t be provided my address or IP or anything, he wouldn&#x27;t be able make my life hell.
